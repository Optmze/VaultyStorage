# VaultyStorage
VaultyStorage is a CLI based tool that provides an easy way for users to securely store and manage access to their files. The features that provided by the tool are:
* <b> Secure Data Storage </b>: Capability to encrypt and compress user-provided files into organized groups called "vaults". 
* <b> Access Control </b>: RSA authenticated and permission-based access for vaults and commands
* <b> Logging and Auditing</b>: Logging of user actions and a quick way to retrieve them.
* <b> Versioning and Snapshots </b>: Allows users to maintain multiple snapshots or versions of their vaults.
